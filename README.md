# Hello-World
Hi Nana here!
Let's get satarted with Github!

I am noob to programming. Working to catch up as much as I can , well one oof GitHub-Guides told me to write a bit about yourself. 
So I just started learning programming and made 1-2 webpages on codepen , that's it nothing much . And one more thing I like programming and Coffee along with music.
